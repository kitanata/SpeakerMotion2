Bugs
------
1. Add location on event creation page does not popup a location form.
2. Create event submit button on event creation page does not submit the form.
4. Signing up as a speaker sometimes causes a 500 internal service error. (The about me is more than 500 characters. Need a better error to show the user, need to lengthen this to 2000 characters. Don't create the user if we cant create the profile.)
7. Date picker should close when minutes are selected.
8. Add link to profile should be smart enough to differentiate between username for social profiles
and fully qualified domain names.
9. If there are no tags on a talk don't indent the talk event views.

Requests
--------
1. Add or link to source code on a talks page. Integrate with github and bitbucket?

Current Priorities

1. Gamification of Profile Completition
2. Social Viral Posts

Speaker Ranking Algorithm Considerations
- Average Rating among all talks
- Number of events I spoke at
- Number of endorsements across all talks I've given
- Number of talks I've given at events
- Number of followers

Event Planner Priorities
- Data analytics and reports and visualizations (on attendance, talks, speakers, whats hot or trending etc)
- Handle Registration and do kickstarter like pledge and ticket levels with different rewards
- Everybody that Registered
- Everybody that showed
- Everybody that registered but didn't come
- Cross event marketing

1. Polish
- Polish the site.
- Test in Firefox.
- Test in IE8 and IE9. (do a browser update page for IE8 and below).

2. Mobile App
- As an attendee I should be able to see upcoming talks on the first page.
- As an attendee I should be able to search for talks by name on my mobile phone.
- As an attendee I should be able to search for speakers by name on my mobile phone.
- As an attendee I should be able to endorse talks on my mobile phone.
- As an attendee I should be able to comment on a talk on my mobile phone.

3. Advanced Ratings (Survey)
- As a speaker I should be able to enable or disable this on my talks.

4. Notifications
- As a speaker when someone follows me.
- As a speaker when someone comments on one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone tags one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone endorses one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone I am following publishes a new talk.
- As a speaker when someone confirmed themselves as attending one of my talks.

5. Social Virtual Requirements
- Post to facebook and linked in when a user registers
- Post to facebook when a speaker creates a talk

6. Other Stuff
- If I click on a tag it should have me tag it too. Maybe with a plus sign.
- Guest Speakers
- Comment Threads. Users can respond to comments on their talks.
- Better Location Support (Only show 100mi radius stuff)
