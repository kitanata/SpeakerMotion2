1. Location Improvements
- When adding a talk the location selector should be a search typeahead control
- Locations for a talk should be a second step to the talk integration.
- When creating a talk I should be able to search for a location or
-    add a new one to the talk.

2. Talk - Event Relationship
- Talks should be able to have new events attached to them. I may have given
the same talk several times and so I simply would like to add a new "Event" which
pairs the talk, the location, and the date and time. People comment on the talk
across events, not on the single event.
- The talk onboarding process should be:
    1. Describe the talk
    2. Pick a location and time for the talk (Possibly create a new location)
    4. Return to profile

3. Notifications
- As a speaker when someone follows me.
- As a speaker when someone comments on one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone tags one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone endorses one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone I am following publishes a new talk.
- As a speaker when someone confirmed themselves as attending one of my talks.

4. Polish
- Polish the site.

5. Advanced Ratings
- As an attendee I should be able to rate a speaker on 5 qualities.
   - Engagement - Did the speaker keep attendees at the talk engaged and interested in the topic being presented?
   - Knowledge - Did the speaker seem extremely knowledgable on the subject?
   - Professionalism - Did the speaker remain professional throughout the talk?
   - Resources - Did the speaker offer external resources for attendees such as websites or presentation slides?
   - Discussion - Did the speaker encourage further discussion on the topic and answer questions appropriately?
- As a speaker I should be able to enable or disable this on my talks.

6. Mobile App
- As an attendee I should be able to endorse talks on my mobile phone.
- As an attendee I should be able to search for talks by name on my mobile phone.
- As an attendee I should be able to comment on a talk on my mobile phone.
