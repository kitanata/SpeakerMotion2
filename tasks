Speaker Ranking Algorithm

Considerations
- Number of events I spoke at
- Number of endorsements across all talks I've given
- Number of talks I've given at events
- Number of followers

Event Planner Priorities
- Handle Registration and do kickstarter like pledge and ticket levels with different rewards
- Data analytics and reports and visualizations (on attendance, talks, speakers, whats hot or trending etc)
- Everybody that Registered
- Everybody that showed
- Everybody that registered but didn't come
- Cross event marketing

1. Polish
- Polish the site.
- Test in Firefox.
- Test in IE8 and IE9. (do a browser update page for IE8 and below).

2. Mobile App
- As an attendee I should be able to see upcoming talks on the first page.
- As an attendee I should be able to search for talks by name on my mobile phone.
- As an attendee I should be able to search for speakers by name on my mobile phone.
- As an attendee I should be able to endorse talks on my mobile phone.
- As an attendee I should be able to comment on a talk on my mobile phone.

3. Advanced Ratings (Survey)
- As an attendee I should be able to rate a speaker on 5 qualities.
   - Engagement - Did the speaker keep attendees at the talk engaged and interested in the topic being presented?
   - Knowledge - Did the speaker seem extremely knowledgable on the subject?
   - Professionalism - Did the speaker remain professional throughout the talk?
   - Resources - Did the speaker offer external resources for attendees such as websites or presentation slides?
   - Discussion - Did the speaker encourage further discussion on the topic and answer questions appropriately?
- As a speaker I should be able to enable or disable this on my talks.
- Put the rate button next to the endorse button. Put the rating form/ajax inside a colorbox.

4. Notifications
- As a speaker when someone follows me.
- As a speaker when someone comments on one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone tags one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone endorses one of my talks.
- As a speaker when someone I am following publishes a new talk.
- As a speaker when someone confirmed themselves as attending one of my talks.

5. Social Integrations
- As an attendee I should be able to use the app by just logging in with my facebook account.
- As a speaker I should be able to import my data and networks from linked in.

6. Other Stuff
- If I click on a tag it should have me tag it too. Maybe with a plus sign.
- A blog on the front page.
- Guest Speakers
- Comment Threads. Users can respond to comments on their talks.
- Better Location Support (Only show 100mi radius stuff)
- Search (for talks, for events, by name, by location, by speaker)
